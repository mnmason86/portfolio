Greetings, guys, gals, and non-binary pals! My name is Mandy Mason, and I am a Software Developer with a background in Music Performance, Education, and Customer Service. I live in Port Saint Lucie, Florida but I grew up in the Nashville area. I taught k-12 music for eight years in Tennessee and Florida before making my career change to tech. I want to bring my communication and leadership experiences from Education and Customer Service to the tech industry. I have always had a love for math, science, and technology, and enjoy learning new things and problem solving. My goal is to bring all of those interests and experiences together into one amazing career!
